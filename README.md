- Analyzing Data in Python
- Identifying and Handling Missing Values
- Data Formatting
- Applying Normalization to dataset
- Binning
- Bins Visualization
- Dummy Variables
- Export


## Usage

```javascript
df.head() , df.info() , df.dtypes() , df.tail() ,... etc.

```

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm just a curious guy ...


## Appendix

- 1> Importing and Exporting Data in Python-- 
Importing data from multiple data sources using the Pandas library and Exporting files into different formats.

- 2> Analyzing Data in Python-- 
Data Analysis in Python using functions like df.head() to view the first few lines of the dataset, df.info() to view the column names and df.dtypes() to view data types data types.. etc.

- 3> Identifying and Handling Missing Values -- 
Drop rows with incomplete information and impute missing data using the mean values.

- 4> Data Formatting -- 
Wrangle features in a dataset and making it meaningful for data analysis.

- 5> Applying Normalization to dataset -- 
Relevance of using feature scaling on data and Normalization and Standardization effects on data analysis.

- 6> Binning -- 
A process of transforming continuous numerical variables into discrete categorical 'bins' for grouped analysis.

- 7> Bins Visualization -- 
A histogram is used to visualize the distribution of bins

- 8> Dummy Variable --
It's a numerical variable used to label categories. They are called 'dummies' because the numbers themselves don't have inherent meaning.
w/ this dummy vaiable,  we can use categorical variables for regression analysis.
